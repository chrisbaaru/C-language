# C-language
My first programming language to learn and to practice. It was quite interesting and through this, I came by to know programming terms such as variables, pointers, arrays,
character key sets and many other. As i continue expanding my knowledge on programming, if find C language and JS a bit related in syntax.
So this was a my first exposure and it was fun
